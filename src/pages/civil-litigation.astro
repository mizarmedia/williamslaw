  {
    question: "What's the difference between civil and criminal cases?",
    answer: "In a <strong>criminal case</strong>, the government prosecutes someone for breaking the law. The punishment can be jail or fines. In a <strong>civil case</strong>, one person (or company) sues another for money damages or to make them do (or stop doing) something. Matt handles both - he's a former prosecutor who now does criminal defense AND civil litigation."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to sue someone?",
    answer: "It depends on the case. Some cases (like personal injury or employment) can be handled on contingency - Matt only gets paid if you win. Other cases require hourly billing or a flat fee. Matt will explain the options during your free consultation and help you understand the costs vs. potential recovery."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do civil cases take?",
    answer: "Simple cases might settle in a few months. Complex cases can take 1-2 years or more if they go to trial. Most cases settle before trial, but having a lawyer who's ready to try the case gives you leverage in negotiations. Matt won't drag things out unnecessarily, but he won't rush into a bad settlement either."
  },
  {
    question: "What can I recover in a civil lawsuit?",
    answer: "Depending on your case, you might recover: <strong>compensatory damages</strong> (money for your actual losses - medical bills, lost wages, property damage), <strong>pain and suffering</strong> (compensation for physical and emotional distress), and sometimes <strong>punitive damages</strong> (extra money to punish especially bad behavior). Attorney fees may also be recoverable in some cases."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I try to settle or go to trial?",
    answer: "It depends. Settlement is faster, cheaper, and guaranteed. Trial is risky - you might win big or get nothing. Matt's approach: prepare every case as if it's going to trial, but be open to fair settlement. When the other side knows you're willing to fight, they offer more to settle."

            Maybe your employer fired you for blowing the whistle on illegal activity. Maybe the police violated your civil rights. Maybe a company's defective product injured you. Maybe someone simply refused to honor their contract.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal system is supposed to make things right. But big companies and government agencies have teams of lawyers. They count on regular people giving up because it's too hard or too expensive to fight.
