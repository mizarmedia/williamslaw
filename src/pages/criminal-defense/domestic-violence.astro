  {
    question: "What counts as domestic violence in Idaho?",
    answer: "Idaho law defines domestic violence broadly. It includes physical harm, threats, or harassment between: spouses or ex-spouses, people who live together or used to, people who have a child together, or people in a dating relationship. It doesn't require serious injury - even pushing or grabbing can lead to charges."
  },
  {
    question: "Can the accuser drop the charges?",
    answer: "No. Once the police are called, the decision to press charges is up to the prosecutor, not the accuser. Many people are surprised to learn that even if the accuser wants to drop it, the state can (and often does) proceed anyway. This is why having a skilled defense attorney matters so much."
  },
  {
    question: "What if the accusations are false?",
    answer: "False accusations happen more often than people think, especially during contentious divorces or custody battles. Matt will investigate the accuser's motives, look for inconsistencies in their story, and gather evidence that shows the truth. He's seen these tactics before and knows how to expose them."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I be able to go home?",
    answer: "Usually not immediately. Judges routinely issue no-contact orders after domestic violence arrests. This can mean you can't go home, can't see your children, and can't communicate with your spouse. Matt can file motions to modify these orders once he understands your situation."
  },
  {
    question: "How will this affect my custody case?",
    answer: "Domestic violence allegations can seriously hurt you in family court. Judges are required to consider domestic violence when making custody decisions. This is another reason why fighting the charges - or at least getting them reduced - is so important. Matt handles both criminal and family law cases, so he understands how they intersect."

        <div class="prose prose-sm md:prose-base mx-auto text-text-gray">
          <p>
            Domestic violence charges are different from other crimes. The moment police arrive, they're trained to make an arrest. Someone is going to jail that night - whether anything actually happened or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once charged, you're immediately separated from your home and family. A no-contact order means you can't talk to your spouse or see your kids. Your name might be in the news. Employers find out. Friends take sides.
          </p>
          <p>
            And here's what makes it worse: <strong>false accusations happen</strong>. In heated divorces, custody battles, or arguments that get out of hand, people sometimes say things that aren't true. The police don't sort that out - they just arrest.
