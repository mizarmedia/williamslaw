  {
    question: "What makes a crime a felony instead of a misdemeanor?",
    answer: "In Idaho, a <strong>felony</strong> is any crime that can be punished by more than 1 year in state prison. Misdemeanors are punishable by up to 1 year in county jail. The same act can sometimes be charged as either, depending on the circumstances - for example, the value of stolen property or whether someone was injured."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a felony be reduced to a misdemeanor?",
    answer: "Yes, in many cases. Idaho has \"wobbler\" offenses that can be charged as either a felony or misdemeanor. Even when charged as a felony, Matt can sometimes negotiate a reduction based on the evidence, your history, and other factors. This is a common goal in plea negotiations."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I go to prison?",
    answer: "Not necessarily. Many felonies can result in probation, especially for first-time offenders. Matt will review your specific situation and give you an honest assessment. He'll fight for alternatives to incarceration when possible - like probation, treatment programs, or community service."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a felony be expunged from my record?",
    answer: "Idaho allows some felonies to be expunged (erased from your record) after you complete your sentence and stay out of trouble for a period of time. The waiting period depends on the crime. Matt can advise you on expungement eligibility and help with the process when the time comes."
  },
  {
    question: "What rights do I lose with a felony conviction?",
    answer: "In Idaho, felony convictions can result in losing: the right to vote (while incarcerated), the right to own firearms, the ability to hold certain professional licenses, and the right to serve on a jury. Some rights can be restored after completing your sentence. These long-term consequences make fighting the charges so important."

            A felony isn't just a legal problem - it can change your entire life. Prison time means losing years with your family. A felony record can mean losing your job, your home, your right to vote, and your ability to own a firearm.

          <p>
            The prosecution has unlimited resources: investigators, forensic labs, expert witnesses. They've already decided you're guilty. They're not looking for the truth - they're building a case.
