    question: "Will I lose my license for a DUI?",
    answer: "Not necessarily. Idaho has both criminal penalties and administrative license suspension. You have only <strong>7 days</strong> after your arrest to request a hearing to fight the license suspension. Matt can help you navigate both the criminal case and the DMV process to give you the best chance of keeping your license."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I refuse a breathalyzer test?",
    answer: "You can, but there are consequences. Idaho has an \"implied consent\" law - by driving on Idaho roads, you've already agreed to chemical testing. Refusing can result in automatic license suspension for 1 year (first offense) and can be used against you in court. However, refusing also means less evidence for the prosecution."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the penalties for a first DUI in Idaho?",
    answer: "A first DUI in Idaho is a misdemeanor. Penalties can include: up to 6 months in jail, fines up to $1,000, license suspension for 90-180 days, required alcohol evaluation, and possible ignition interlock device. But penalties depend on your specific situation - blood alcohol level, whether there was an accident, and other factors."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a DUI be reduced to a lesser charge?",
    answer: "Yes, in many cases. Depending on the strength of the evidence, Matt may be able to negotiate a reduction to reckless driving (\"wet reckless\") or inattentive driving. These carry lesser penalties and may not have the same long-term consequences as a DUI conviction."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I was barely over the limit?",
    answer: "This is actually good for your defense. Breathalyzers have a margin of error, typically around 0.01%. If you were at 0.08 or 0.09, that margin of error could put you under the legal limit. Matt will examine the maintenance records and calibration of the device to challenge borderline results."

            Getting pulled over and charged with DUI is scary. You might lose your license. You could face jail time. Your insurance will go up. It can affect your job. The stigma alone is overwhelming.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's the thing: <strong>being charged doesn't mean you're guilty</strong>. The police and prosecutors make mistakes. Breathalyzers can be wrong. Field tests aren't always accurate. Traffic stops can be illegal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The prosecution has to prove every element of their case. A skilled defense attorney finds the holes and makes them prove it.
