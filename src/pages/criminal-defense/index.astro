    question: "What should I do if I get arrested?",
    answer: "Stay calm. Be polite to the officers, but <strong>don't answer questions about what happened</strong>. You have the right to remain silent - use it. Ask for a lawyer immediately. Don't try to talk your way out of it - that almost always makes things worse. Call Matt as soon as you can."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a former prosecutor really help me?",
    answer: "Yes - and here's why. Matt spent nearly 10 years as a prosecutor. He knows exactly how the other side builds their cases, what evidence they rely on, and what makes cases fall apart. When you hire a former prosecutor, you're hiring someone who knows the playbook because he helped write it."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony?",
    answer: "A <strong>misdemeanor</strong> is a less serious crime, usually punishable by up to 1 year in county jail and fines. A <strong>felony</strong> is more serious and can mean prison time (more than 1 year) and larger fines. Felonies also stay on your record and can affect your right to vote, own firearms, and get certain jobs."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I go to jail?",
    answer: "It depends on your specific situation - the charges, your history, and the evidence. Matt will review your case and give you an honest assessment of what you're facing. Many cases result in no jail time, but the only way to know your situation is to discuss the details."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a criminal defense lawyer cost?",
    answer: "Costs vary based on the complexity of your case. Matt offers a free consultation where he'll review your situation and discuss fees upfront. He believes everyone deserves strong defense, and he'll work with you on payment options. The real question is: what's your freedom worth?"

          <p>
            Getting charged with a crime is terrifying. The police have already decided you did it. The prosecutor is building a case against you. It feels like the whole system is stacked against you.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's what most people don't realize: <strong>the prosecution has to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt</strong>. That's a high bar. Police make mistakes. Evidence gets mishandled. Witnesses get things wrong. Constitutional rights get violated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your job isn't to prove you're innocent. Their job is to prove you're guilty. A good defense attorney makes that job as hard as possible.
