const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How long does divorce take in Idaho?",
    answer: "At minimum, 20 days - that's the waiting period after filing. But most divorces take longer. An uncontested divorce where both sides agree on everything might take 2-3 months. A contested divorce with disputes about property, custody, or support can take 6 months to over a year. Matt works to resolve issues efficiently while protecting your interests."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to go to court?",
    answer: "Not always. Many family law matters can be resolved through negotiation or mediation. If you and your spouse can agree on the major issues, the court may just need to approve your agreement. But if the other side won't be reasonable, Matt is ready to fight for you in court."
  },
  {
    question: "How is property divided in an Idaho divorce?",
    answer: "Idaho is a <strong>community property</strong> state. That means most assets acquired during the marriage are split 50/50. But there are exceptions: inheritances, gifts, and property owned before marriage may be separate property. The devil is in the details, and Matt knows how to identify and protect what's rightfully yours."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my spouse is hiding assets?",
    answer: "This happens more often than you'd think. Matt knows how to find hidden assets through discovery, subpoenas, and forensic accounting. He's uncovered hidden bank accounts, underreported income, and assets transferred to family members. If your spouse is being dishonest, Matt will find out."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get alimony?",
    answer: "Idaho calls it \"spousal maintenance\" and it's not automatic. Courts consider: how long you were married, your ability to support yourself, your spouse's ability to pay, and the standard of living during the marriage. Matt can evaluate whether you should seek maintenance or defend against an unfair request."

          <p>
            Unlike criminal law, where there's a winner and a loser, family law is about finding a path forward. Even in contentious divorces, you might have to co-parent with your ex for years to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            Matt's approach: <strong>Fight hard for what matters. Be reasonable about what doesn't.</strong> He won't escalate conflict just to run up legal bills. But when the other side is being unreasonable, he won't back down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most importantly, Matt keeps your children's wellbeing at the center of every decision. They didn't ask for this situation, and they deserve parents who can work together.
