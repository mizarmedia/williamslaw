  {
    question: "What's the difference between contested and uncontested divorce?",
    answer: "An <strong>uncontested divorce</strong> is when you and your spouse agree on everything - property division, custody, support. It's faster, cheaper, and less stressful. A <strong>contested divorce</strong> is when you can't agree and need the court to decide. Matt can help with either, but always tries to reach agreement first when possible."
  },
  {
    question: "How is property divided?",
    answer: "Idaho is a <strong>community property</strong> state. Assets acquired during marriage are generally split 50/50. But separate property (what you owned before marriage, inheritances, gifts) stays yours. The tricky part is figuring out what's community vs. separate, especially when accounts have been mixed. Matt knows how to trace and protect your property."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I keep the house?",
    answer: "Maybe. The house is usually the biggest asset, and both spouses often want it. Options include: one person buys out the other's share, sell the house and split the proceeds, or continue co-owning temporarily (less common). Matt will help you figure out what's financially smart for your situation."
  },
  {
    question: "What about retirement accounts and pensions?",
    answer: "Retirement accounts earned during marriage are community property and can be divided. This requires a special court order called a QDRO (Qualified Domestic Relations Order). It's one of the most commonly mishandled parts of divorce. Matt makes sure these valuable assets are properly addressed."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I protect myself financially during divorce?",
    answer: "First, gather documentation - bank statements, tax returns, retirement account statements, property records. Make copies before anything can \"disappear.\" Don't hide assets (courts punish this). Don't make major financial changes. And get a lawyer early - the decisions made at the start of divorce often shape the outcome."

              <p class="text-text-gray text-xs md:text-sm">
                One spouse files a petition for divorce and serves it on the other. Idaho requires at least one spouse to have lived in Idaho for 6 weeks before filing. No specific grounds are required - Idaho allows "irreconcilable differences" (no-fault divorce).

              <p class="text-text-gray text-xs md:text-sm">
                Idaho has a mandatory 20-day waiting period after filing. This is meant to give people time to reconsider. During this time, both sides gather financial documents and prepare their positions.

              <p class="text-text-gray text-xs md:text-sm">
                Most divorces settle through negotiation. Matt tries to reach fair agreements on property, custody, and support without going to court. If the other side won't be reasonable, he's prepared to litigate.

Example: You had $50,000 in savings before marriage, but deposited your paychecks into the same account for 10 years. Now it may all be community property. Matt knows how to trace funds and protect separate property.

              Litigation is expensive and stressful. Matt always tries to negotiate a fair settlement first. If you can resolve issues without a trial, you'll save money and emotional energy.

              But some spouses won't be reasonable. When settlement isn't possible, Matt is prepared to go to court and fight for what you deserve. His trial experience matters when negotiation fails.
