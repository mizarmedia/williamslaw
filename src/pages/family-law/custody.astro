    question: "What's the difference between legal and physical custody?",
    answer: "<strong>Legal custody</strong> is the right to make major decisions about your child - education, healthcare, religion. <strong>Physical custody</strong> is where the child lives. You can have joint legal custody (both parents decide together) but primary physical custody (child lives mostly with one parent). Idaho courts often award joint legal custody but vary on physical custody."
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'best interests of the child' mean?",
    answer: "It's the standard Idaho courts use to make custody decisions. They look at: each parent's relationship with the child, the child's adjustment to home and school, each parent's mental and physical health, any history of domestic violence, and the child's wishes (if they're old enough). Matt helps you present evidence that shows why your proposed arrangement serves your child's best interests."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I move away with my child?",
    answer: "Not without permission if there's a custody order. Idaho requires you to get the other parent's agreement or court approval before relocating with your child. The court will consider how the move affects the child's relationship with the other parent. Matt can help you with relocation cases - whether you want to move or you're opposing a move."
  },
  {
    question: "At what age can my child decide who to live with?",
    answer: "There's no magic age. Idaho law says the court <strong>may</strong> consider the child's wishes if they're old enough and mature enough to form a reasonable preference. Judges typically give more weight to teenagers' preferences, but it's never the only factor. The child's best interests - not just their preference - controls the outcome."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my ex violates the custody order?",
    answer: "Document every violation. If your ex regularly ignores the custody schedule or makes unilateral decisions, Matt can file a motion for contempt. Courts take custody violations seriously. Repeated violations can result in fines, makeup time, and even changes to the custody arrangement."

            What Idaho Courts Look At
          </h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-text-gray max-w-2xl mx-auto">
            Courts decide custody based on the "best interests of the child." Here's what that really means.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 md:gap-5">

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-1 text-sm md:text-base">Parent-Child Relationship</h3>
            <p class="text-text-gray text-xs md:text-sm">
              How involved is each parent? Who helps with homework, attends activities, handles doctor visits? Courts want to see who's been actively parenting, not just present.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-offwhite p-3 md:p-5 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-1 text-sm md:text-base">Stability</h3>
            <p class="text-text-gray text-xs md:text-sm">
              Kids do better with stability. Courts look at each parent's living situation, work schedule, and ability to provide a stable home. Frequent moves or chaotic lifestyles can hurt your case.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-offwhite p-3 md:p-5 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-1 text-sm md:text-base">Willingness to Co-Parent</h3>
            <p class="text-text-gray text-xs md:text-sm">
              Courts favor parents who support the child's relationship with the other parent. Badmouthing, blocking communication, or alienating the child from the other parent looks very bad.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-offwhite p-3 md:p-5 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-1 text-sm md:text-base">Safety Concerns</h3>
            <p class="text-text-gray text-xs md:text-sm">
              History of domestic violence, substance abuse, or neglect matters a lot. Courts prioritize the child's safety. If there are real concerns, Matt knows how to present evidence effectively.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-1 text-sm md:text-base">Child's Adjustment</h3>
            <p class="text-text-gray text-xs md:text-sm">
              How is the child doing in their current school? Do they have friends? Are they thriving? Courts hesitate to disrupt a child who's doing well unless there's a good reason.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-offwhite p-3 md:p-5 rounded-lg">

            <p class="text-text-gray text-xs md:text-sm">
              If the child is old enough (usually pre-teen or teen), the court may consider what they want. But it's not the only factor - judges won't let a child decide if the preference isn't in their best interest.

              Child spends significant time with both parents. Common arrangements: week on/week off, 2-2-3 schedule, or 3-4-4-3 schedule. Works best when parents live close and can communicate civilly.

              Child lives mainly with one parent; the other has regular visitation (often every other weekend plus one weeknight, plus holidays and summer time).

              One parent has both physical and legal custody. The other may have supervised visitation or no contact. Courts order this when one parent poses a risk to the child.

            <p class="text-text-gray/70 text-xs">
